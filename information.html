		<li> <h2> When Bangladesh was founded in the year March 17th, 1971, it was right after they gained their independence in war with Pakistan. The war was a result of the people being oppressed as a colony of Pakistan as America was for Britain. After gaining independence from Pakistan, Bangladesh adopted a flag of a red dot inside of a mainly green flag. People in Bangladesh speak Bangla as their primary language.</h2> </li>
		<li> <h2>Bangladesh is also home to one of the biggest sand beaches in the world. The beach is called Cox's Bazar and spans up to 250.58 miles squared in total land area. Bangladesh is also very densely populated being the 8th most populated country in the world while being the 95th largest country.  </h2> </li>
		<li> <h2>While it isn’t the smallest country it still holds a much higher population to land ratio than that of other countries that are way bigger than it. Bangladesh is still a developing country though with potential to grow into a bigger economically inclined country due to its accessibility to the Bay of Bengal. </h2> </li>
		<h2> On the right is a map of the entirity of Bangladesh that seperates all of the cities and a population pyramid for Bangladesh. </h2>
